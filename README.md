# css-zen-garden

The Css Zen Garden is a challenge that has been around for a decade. (Happy birthday CSSZG!) In this challenge, designers download an HTML file and have to use only the CSS to create a unique and original site.  

For my Zen Garden, I designed around the style of Russian Constructivism. I used CSS Animations and pseudu classes to create a site based on the propoganda posters of the time period.  

Toolkit:
[] HTML
[] CSS
[] CSS Animations
[] Psuedo classes
[] Responsive web design
[] Research
[] Working with restrictions
